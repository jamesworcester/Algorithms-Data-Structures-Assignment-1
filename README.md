# Algorithms-Data-Structures-Assignment-1
Assignment revolved around creating an algorith that:
- creates a lexicon of words from various text files (case-insensitive), where words are only stored once and punctuation and numerical charactesr are removed
- word frequency is stored for each word in the lexicon
- each word in the lexicon also stores a list of neighbouring words, where a neighbour is defined as a word that differs by only one character
- sorts the lexicon using two different sorting algorithms
- writes the lexicon to a text file
- creates a word class
